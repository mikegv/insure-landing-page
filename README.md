### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The CSS in this project was very challenging.  Some of the elements overlap or are not in the normal flow of the document. Going through the process of writing CSS to match the design taught me a lot about what I could do with CSS.
